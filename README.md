## FAQ

#### In which folder do I upload my files for my site?

Here the "www" folder is used as a public folder, which can be accessed by everyone. Added files can be accessed in this folder.

## How to use https://

#### Using another port

Go to the file:

```bash
/home/container/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
```

Change "listen" to:

```bash
listen <YOUR_PORT> ssl;
```

Please also change the spacer distance. Otherwise the "listen" will be overwritten each time the egg is restarted.

Add the following lines:

```bash
    ssl_certificate /home/container/your_cert.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /home/container/your_cert_key.key;
    ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
    ssl_ciphers HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5;
```

Adjust the lines accordingly.
Furthermore, if not already done, adjust to your domain:

```bash
server_name www.example.com;
```

#### Reverse Proxy

I'd reccomend this route as it is more centralized but it overall depends on what you want to acheive!

This isn't required, but you will need it if you want to see the client IP address in your code and logs.

1) Set up your reverse proxy to redirect traffic from your (sub)domain to your port exposed by the container, should be easy to do but depends on alot of stuff so it is outside the scope of this. Make sure to add X-Forwarded-For header with the IP of the client.
2) Change the variable in the admin configuration and restart the container

## Change PHP version

Changing the PHP version is currently still somewhat cumbersome. A revised version will be available in the future.

- **Step 1:** Change the content of the file "php_version.txt" in "/home/container" to the version you want e.g. "8.3"

- **Step 2:** In your Pterodactyl panel, go to the "Startup" tab on your web server. Change the variable "PHP VERSION" to the desired version.
  ![variable](https://github.com/Ym0T/pterodactyl-nginx-egg/assets/104158130/84bbbf16-0c1d-4c4b-bac7-c84fb4550afa)
- **Step 3:** Finally, you need to customise the Docker image. Select the appropriate Docker image to match the version.

- **Step 4:** Restart your container
